    "# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is EDA**? Once a dataset is loaded, the first step is to learn something about it. If the dataset is small, we can often study it by directly inspecting the table (e.g., using Excel). If the dataset is large, manual inspection of data elements is time consuming and it might be dificult to make sense of it. In this case, it is a good idea to use data visualization tools to explore the original data or some of its properties (often called \"statistics\"). There are many ways to visualize a dataset and the process of getting acquanted with the data is called the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Types of datasets**.\n",
    "There are many types of datasets and this influences how we think about the data, how we visualize it, and how we make sense of it. The most common types of datasets that we will encounter are:\n",
    "- *tabular* (dataset is represented as a 2d array / spredsheet, like a spreadsheet in Excel)\n",
    " - *numerical* (if all the values in the table are numerical, the table can be treated as a matrix -- many data science tools only work on numeric data)\n",
    " - *mixed type* (different columns might be of different types; some can be numeric, some can be text, some can be references to objects)\n",
    "- *relational* (consisting of multiple tables, like in databases)\n",
    "- *temporal* (a value or values that change in time, e.g., daily temperatures during 2016 in Philadelphia; it could also be multiple time series, e.g., daily temperatures, humidity, wind speed in Philadelphia) \n",
    "- *spatial* (a value or values that change over space, e.g., current temperatures in multiple cities or over the whole U.S.; data could also be spatio-temporal, like daily temperatures, humidity, and wind over the U.S. during 2016)\n",
    "- *network* (dataset is represented as a graph, where nodes and edges can have their own properties and values, e.g., social network data with people as nodes and their friendships as edges)\n",
    "- *unstructured* (datasets that do not belong to any of the above categories, such as one or a collection of html documents; typically, unstructured datasets need to be converted to one of the structured formats before they could be studied by data science tools)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tabular data**\n",
    "Standard terminology:\n",
    "- rows, also referred to as examples, data points\n",
    "- columns, also refered to as attributes, features, variables\n",
    "- $X$ denotes a table, $X_{ij}$ denotes the value in the i-th row and j-th column\n",
    "- Size of $X$ refers to the number of rows $N$ and number of columns $M$\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of attributes:\n",
    "- *numeric*:\n",
    " - *nominal* / categorical (e.g., color of a car which can be encoded as {'blue': 1, 'red': 2, 'green metalic': 3}; it cannot be stated that 1 is more similar to 2 than to 3)  \n",
    " - *ordinal* (e.g., rating for a movie; we can claim that rating 5 is better than 4, but cannot reason that the difference between movies rated as 4 and 5 is the same as the difference between movies rated as 2 and 3)\n",
    " - *interval* (e.g., temperatures in Fahrenheit; we can claim that +72 is warmer than +70, and we know that difference of 2 degrees has a clearly defined physical meaning)\n",
    " - *ratio* (e.g., distance; we can claim that 3 miles is twice as long as 1.5 miles)\n",
    "- *non-numeric* (very often text strings, but more generally links to objects)\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, numerical attributes can be divided into dimensions and measures (e.g., dimension is time and measure is temperature at a given time). We will talk more about it when we cover Tableau software. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Visualization of tabular data \n",
    "In visualization, we either plot the raw data or some of its derivations (also called *statistics*). We will illustrate some standard visualization techniques on *Auto MPG data* from UCI Data Repository (this is also the data set used in `Lab2`): https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/auto+mpg. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start using python for EDA, let us open the dataset in Excel and try to understand what we are dealing with. If a dataset is tabular and relatively small, opening it first in Excel or some other spreadsheet processing software is usually a good practice.\n",
    "\n",
